# odin-recipes
first assignment via odinproject
putting all my HTML knowledge into practice. In this repository, I shall be writing a food recipe (yes!) via proper usage of HTML. I've been practicing it for a week now and it's time to see and show how much I've learned and whether to move forward or revise my knowledge again. Wish me luck!!
